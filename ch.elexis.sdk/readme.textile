__MEDEVIT <office@medevit.at>__ Last update: 15.5.2015

This project is used to automatically set-up an Elexis 3 development environment using
the "Eclipse Oomph Installer":http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Oomph_Installer.

It integrates both core, base and "Medelexis":http://www.medelexis.ch  resources. This project is not used outside of the Oomph installer tool.

This documentation was verified with Oomph v1.1. The setup file referenced in this document is located in the root of this git repository (that is @../Elexis.setup@ )

h2. Usage

Eclipse Oomph is a toolkit to realize automated installations of project specific Eclipse installations. It is hence used to set-up Eclipse for a specific project. In order to employ Oomph to setup an Elexis development environment we proceed as follows:

# Download Oomph specific to your system from "https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Installer":https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Installer 
# Start Oomph (eclipse installer) and switch to the __Advanced__  wizard  <br> !images/switchToAdvanced.png! 
# In the advanced wizard select __Eclipse for RCP and RAP developers__ as @Product@   and select **Next>** 
# Now you see the list of @Projects@, here you have to add the setup file for Elexis. The setup file can be accessed in raw format using the link "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elexis/elexis-3-core/master/Elexis.setup":https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elexis/elexis-3-core/master/Elexis.setup . Add it as follows <br> !images/addElexisUrlToOomph.png!
# Now you add the required Elexis parts to your installation setup. There exist four different pars
## @Elexis@ ( "elexis-3-core":https://github.com/elexis/elexis-3-core/ and "elexis-3-base":https://github.com/elexis/elexis-3-base/ ) - contains the base open source elexis, a github account is required
## @Medelexis@  - the Medelexis plugins part, only accessible to users who have access to the Medelexis repo
## @Medelexis Application@  - the core Medelexis application, only accessible to core Medelexis developers
## @Austria@ ( "elexis-3-austria":https://github.com/elexis/elexis-3-austria ) - setup for plugins specific to Austrian requirements , requires github account
# for a default open source development environment in the master stream select the projects as follows <br> !images/selectProjects.png!
# After pressing **Next>** again you have to select the installation folder name, use @elexis@ or whatever fits you. Here you will finally find your pre-configured development environment for Elexis open source.
# Pressing **Next>** again you can verify the settings and start the installation with **Finish**. This will take a while.
# After the basic product installation was done, the newly installed Eclipse IDE is started and the setup tasks are executed (source checkout, IDE configuration etc.).
